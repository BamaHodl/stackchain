ABSTRACT

Individual plebs may not have enough money to participate in the next stack, and may prefer pooling with other plebs to publish the next stack.

PROCESS

To pool money for the next stack, the following procedure should be followed:
	1) Visit the @AriZonanHODL Stackchain thread located at 'https://twitter.com/AriZonanHODL/status/1549169119924080640', or the NEWSTACK of your choice.
	2) Find the current Stack Height of the Stackchain. (i.e. $200 USD)
	3) Reply with your intentions to start pooling, and attach an image of your Bitcoin purchase as your initial contribution.
	4) Wait until the amount contributed is equal to the latest tip height. If the tip moves after the proposal is submitted, the threshold is moved too.
	5) Submit a new stack with all contributions

To contribute to a pool:
	1) Make sure your contribution would not bring the pool above the current height.
	2) Make the purchase of your contribution amount.
	3) Reply to the pooling proposal with the image of your purchase.
