# Stackchain

Stackchain is a chain of individual users purchasing bitcoin in USD, increasing by 1 USD for each individual's purchase.

The Genesis Stack is located here on this <a href="https://twitter.com/AriZonanHODL/status/1549169119924080640/">Twitter thread</a>. 


In lamen terms:
"it's just fun and shitposting with a little bit of bitcoin lingo thrown in to make it more fun as we shitpost as we buy bitcoin."
